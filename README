A bunch of Applescripts I wrote or collected. They are grouped per application.

## [Apptivate](http://www.apptivateapp.com/) #

A keyboard launcher, similar to the triggers in Quicksilver.

- **Search** * : Opens up a dialog where you can type your search query on the specific web site.
- **Translate to English**: opens a dialog where you can type the text to translate. You'll be sent to Google Translate. The source language is set to auto-detect.

## [Launchbar](http://obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html)

For the app launcher.

- **Enter Path**: A port of a script that was made for Quicksilver. In a save dialog, or in the Finder, navigate using Launchbar to the path where you want to go, TAB and then select the Enter Path script. It will use the CMD-SHFT-G shortcut to enter the path of the selected item in the save panel or Finder window. (You can place the script in the ~/Application Support/Lauchbar/Actions folder, or anywhere Launchbar sees it.)

## Safari ##

- **Open Safari URL in Chrome**: Opens the current Safari tab in a Chrome tab. I think it came from [TUAW][tuaw].

## [TaskPaper](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper) ##

A ToDo list manager, but also a nice and simple text editor.

- **Goto** * : Scripts that set the search field to a preset text. If you assign keyboard shortcuts to those scripts, it essentially replicate the Perspectives behavior in Omnifocus.
- **TP-To Quick Entry**: I made this to replicate the behavior of the Things Quick Entry panel. It will try to grab the content of the front most application and add it to the entry as a comment. You have to set your TaskPaper Quick Entry keyboard shortcut in the script. So far the script works with:  
    - Safari & Chrome: grabs link
    - iTunes: grabs current song, with "Artist - Song (Album)"
    - Finder: path to select file
    - Mail: Current email's sender, the subject and a link to the email
